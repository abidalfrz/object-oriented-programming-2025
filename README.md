# Object-Oriented Programming Project Collection

This repository is a collection of various projects I developed throughout my journey of learning and practicing OOP principles during my college studies using JAVA language. The purpose of this repository is to document progress, strengthen programming fundamentals, and demonstrate how OOP concepts are applied in real-world problem-solving.

## 🧠 Key OOP Concepts Practiced

* **Encapsulation** – Structuring data and methods inside classes.
* **Inheritance** – Reusing and extending behaviors across classes.
* **Polymorphism** – Designing flexible interfaces for multiple behaviors.
* **Abstraction** – Simplifying complex systems through class models.
* **Class & Object Design** – Building reusable and scalable code structures.
